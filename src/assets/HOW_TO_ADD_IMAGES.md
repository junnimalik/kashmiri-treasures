# How to Add Product Images

This guide explains how to easily add product images without touching any code!

## 📁 Folder Structure

The assets folder has separate folders for each product category:

```
src/assets/
├── shawls/          ← Add shawl/pashmina photos here
├── pherans/         ← Add pheran photos here
├── handbags/        ← Add handbag photos here
├── dry-fruits/      ← Add dry fruits photos here
└── gift-hampers/    ← Add gift hamper photos here
```

## 🚀 How to Add Images

**Simply drag and drop your images into the appropriate folder!**

1. Navigate to the folder for your product category:
   - For shawls: `src/assets/shawls/`
   - For pherans: `src/assets/pherans/`
   - For handbags: `src/assets/handbags/`
   - For dry fruits: `src/assets/dry-fruits/`
   - For gift hampers: `src/assets/gift-hampers/`

2. Copy your product images into that folder

3. **That's it!** The images will automatically appear on the website
